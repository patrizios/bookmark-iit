    This is micro application written in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a>, on the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.yiiframework.com">Yii Framework</a> for manage bookmarks.</p>
    The design is simple, the UI clear. You can add an URL and search it in the list.
    The application get an URL, scrape the HTML page and the favicon and saves them on the database.
